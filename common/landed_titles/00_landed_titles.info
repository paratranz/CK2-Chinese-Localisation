This documentation is rather sparse, sorry. Mainly consists of functionality added in 2.8 or later

can_be_claimed = no 				- Whether claims can be added on the title. If set to "no" (default "yes"), will block all claims, even claims via script
can_be_usurped = no - Whether a title can be usurped. Defaults to "no"
extra_ai_eval_troops = 10000 		- How many more troops the AI should assume someone with this as their primary title has. Has no effect on anything except AI. Higher numbers means others are less willing to attack them, and they're more willing to attack others
hire_range = 1000					- How far away a mercenary title can be hired. If not set, defaults to the MERCENARY_HIRE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD define
